# Hero Line Wars (Swing Arena)

This project contains a lightweight real-time interpretation of the classic Hero Line Wars custom maps. It now ships with a small Swing battlefield so you can move your hero with the mouse and watch the duel unfold without relying on console prompts.

## Gameplay overview

- Choose between three hero archetypes (Ranger, Berserker, or Mage), each with distinct attack ranges and play styles.
- Click anywhere on the lane to command your hero to move. They will automatically attack the opposing hero when in range.
- Earn experience by defeating units and heroes to level up, gaining larger boosts to your primary attribute than your secondary stats.
- Defeat the enemy hero to create openings that let you damage their base. Be carefulâ€”if you fall, the enemy will march toward yours!
- Bases lose health when exposed; the match ends when one base is destroyed.

## Building and running

This project is a plain Java application without external dependencies.

```bash
# Compile all sources
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")

# Run the game
java -cp out com.example.herolinewars.HeroLineWarsGame
```

When the application launches, a hero selection dialog appears. After choosing your hero, the battle begins instantly inside the Swing window.
