# Hero Line Wars (C++ Arena)

This repository now contains a self-contained C++ interpretation of the classic Hero Line Wars skirmish. The original Swing UI
has been replaced with an interactive terminal duel where you recruit units, equip items, and march down the lane wave after wa
ve.

## Gameplay overview

- Choose between three hero archetypes (Ranger, Berserker, or Battle Mage), each with distinct primary attributes.
- Recruit units before every wave to increase your income and tilt the battle in your favour.
- Purchase equipment to specialise your hero and dominate the front line.
- Win waves to damage the opposing baseâ€”lose and your own fortifications crumble.

## Building and running

The project uses CMake and targets C++17.

```bash
# Configure and build (Debug by default)
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build

# Run the duel (macOS/Linux)
./build/hero_line_wars
```

On Windows you can launch the game directly from PowerShell:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/run-game.ps1
```

The script configures (if needed) and builds the project before starting `hero_line_wars.exe`. If you prefer a different build
directory, pass `-BuildDir` or set the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable.

To create a release build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/release --config Release
./build/release/hero_line_wars
```

## Windows executable helper

A PowerShell helper script is available under `scripts/build-windows-exe.ps1`. It configures a Release build with CMake and copy
s the resulting executable into `dist\windows`.
